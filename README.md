#GenCon Event List

This is a very limited search tool for the GenCon event list.

Currently, you have to manually update the url to search.

The format is:
example.com/events?[key]=[value]

The keys currently are:

* id - Event ID - ex. EGM1349269
* group - Event group - ex. SEM
* title - Event title - ex. Punch%20Quest
* desc - Short description
* desc_long - Long description

You can tell it to do a fuzzy search by appending '.fuzzy' to the key.
